# MotioNet 

This library provides the source code of [*MotioNet*]([https://rubbly.cn/publications/motioNet](http://rubbly.cn/publications/motioNet)), [ToG 2020], a method to reconstruct human motion from monocular video. Benefited from a kinematic-based network, designed based on the common motion representation, the reconstructed human motion can be converted to bvh file directly without any post-processing.

The code will be published soon.
